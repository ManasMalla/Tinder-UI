        Single people, listen up: If you’re looking for love, want to start
        dating, or just keep it casual, you need to be on Tinder. With over 55
        billion matches made, it’s the place to be to meet your next best match.
        Let’s be real, the dating landscape looks very different today, as most
        people are meeting online. With Tinder, the world’s most popular free
        dating app, you have millions of other single people at your fingertips
        and they’re all ready to meet someone like you. Whether you’re straight
        or in the LGBTQIA community, Tinder’s here to bring you all the sparks.
        <br /><br />There really is something for everyone on Tinder. Want to
        get into a relationship? You got it. Trying to find some new friends?
        Say no more. New kid on campus and looking to make the most of your
        college experience? Tinder U’s got you covered. Tinder isn’t your
        average dating site — it’s the most diverse dating app, where adults of
        all backgrounds and experiences are invited to make connections,
        memories, and everything in between.
